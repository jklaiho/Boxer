//BXFrameRenderingView is a protocol for views that perform drawing of BXEmulator frames.
//It provides a consistent interface for BXDOSWindowController to communicate with
//different alternative view implementations.

#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

@class BXFrameBuffer;

@protocol BXFrameRenderingView
@property (assign) BOOL managesAspectRatio;

//Tells the view to render the specified frame next time it is redrawn.
//Will usually mark the view as needing display.
- (void) updateWithFrame: (BXFrameBuffer *)frame;

//Returns the current frame being rendered - i.e. the last frame that was passed
//to the view via updateWithFrame:.
- (BXFrameBuffer *) currentFrame;


//Reports the maximum displayable frame size (which may be limited by e.g. OpenGL
//maximum texture dimensions.) Frames larger than this will not be passed to updateWithFrame:.
- (NSSize) maxFrameSize;

//Reports where in the view the current frame will actually be rendered.
//This may be a portion of the total view size, when in fullscreen mode.
