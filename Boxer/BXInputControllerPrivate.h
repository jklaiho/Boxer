#pragma mark Constants for configuring behaviour

//The number of seconds it takes for the cursor to fade out after entering the window.
//Cursor animation is flickery so a small duration helps mask this.
#define BXCursorFadeDuration 0.4

//The framerate at which to animate the cursor fade.
//15fps is as fast as is really noticeable.
#define BXCursorFadeFrameRate 15.0f

//If the cursor is warped less than this distance (relative to a 0.0->1.0 square canvas) then
//the OS X cursor will not be warped to match. Because OS X cursor warping introduces a slight
//input delay, we use this tolerance to ignore small warps.
#define BXCursorWarpTolerance 0.1f

//The volume level at which we'll play the lock/unlock sound effects.
#define BXMouseLockSoundVolume 0.7f

//The maximum length a touch-then-release can last in order to be considered a tap.
#define BXTapDurationThreshold 0.3f

//mouse input is in use by the DOS program, and the mouse is either
//locked or we track the mouse while it's unlocked.

//Returns the DOS keycode constant corresponding to the specified OSX keycode.
