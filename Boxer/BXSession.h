//BXSession is an NSDocument subclass which encapsulates a single DOS emulation session.
//It manages an underlying BXEmulator (configuring, starting and stopping it), reads and writes
//the gamebox for the session (if any), and creates the various window controllers for the session.

//BXSession is extended by separate categories that encapsulate different aspects of functionality
//(mostly for controlling the emulator.)
