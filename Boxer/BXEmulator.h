//BXEmulator is our many-tentacled Cocoa wrapper for DOSBox's low-level emulation functions.
//BXEmulator itself exposes an API for managing emulator startup, shutdown and general state.
//It is extended by more specific categories for managing more other aspects of emulator functionality.

//Because they talk directly to DOSBox, BXEmulator and its categories are Objective C++. All calls
//to DOSBox emulation functionality pass through here or one of its categories.

//Instances of this class are created by BXSession, and like BXSession the active emulator can be accessed
//as a singleton: via [[[NSApp delegate] currentSession] emulator] or just [BXEmulator currentEmulator].
