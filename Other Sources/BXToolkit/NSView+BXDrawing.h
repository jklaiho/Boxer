//The BXDrawing category defines some helper methods on NSViews to make drawing easier.

#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

@interface NSView (BXDrawing)

//Returns the view's offset from the bottom left corner of the window.
//Useful for aligning pattern phase when drawing pattern colours.
- (NSPoint) offsetFromWindowOrigin;

//Returns whether the view is in an active window (the main window or a floating panel).
//This is intended to reflect whether the window appears inactive (dimmed titlebar),
//and thus whether controls within it should draw an active or inactive appearance.
- (BOOL) windowIsActive;
